This is the source of my blog, hosted at [sharats.me](http://sharats.me). It is
powered by [Pelican](http://getpelican.com) and articles are written in
Markdown.

The theme is a heavily modified version of a bootstrap based theme present in
pelican-themes.

All code for generation of the blog (that is written by me) is licensed with the
[MIT License](http://mitl.sharats.me).

If you want to try build this on your system,

    git clone git://github.com/sharat87/sharats.me.git
    cd sharats.me
    pip install -r requirements.txt # You probably want to do this in a virtualenv
    make serve

Then you can just open localhost:8000 and should be good to go.
