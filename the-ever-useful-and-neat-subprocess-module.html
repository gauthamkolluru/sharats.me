        <h1>The ever useful and neat subprocess module</h1>
        <time>29 Apr, 2012</time>    </header>

    <p><p>Python's <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html">subprocess</a> module is one of my favourite modules in the standard
library. If you have ever done some decent amount of coding in python, you might
have encountered it. This module is used for dealing with external commands,
intended to be a replacement to the old <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.system"><code>os.system</code></a> and the like.</p>
<p>The most trivial use might be to get the output of a small shell command like
<code>ls</code> or <code>ps</code>. Not that this is the best way to get a list of files in a
directory (think <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/os.html#os.listdir"><code>os.listdir</code></a>), but you get the point.</p>
<p>I am going to put my notes and experiences about this module here. Please note,
I wrote this with Python 2.7 in mind. Things <strong>are</strong> slightly different in other
versions (even 2.6). If you find any errors or suggestions, please let me know.</p>

<h1 id="a-simple-usage">A simple usage</h1>
<p>For the sake of providing context, lets run the <code>ls</code> command from subprocess
and get its output</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">subprocess</span>
<span class="n">ls_output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">check_output</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I'll cover getting output from a command in detail later. To give more command
line arguments,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">check_output</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;-l&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The first item in the list is the executable and rest are its command line
arguments (<code>argv</code> equivalent). No quirky shell quoting and complex nested quote
rules to digest. Just a plain python list.</p>
<p>However, not having shell quoting implies you don't also have the shell
niceties. Like piping for one. The following won't work the way one would expect
it to.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">check_output</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;|&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;wc&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;-l&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Here, the <code>ls</code> command gets its first command as <code>|</code> and I have no idea what ls
would do with it. Perhaps complain that no such file exists. So, instead, we
have to use the <code>shell</code> boolean argument. More later down in the article.</p>
<h1 id="popen-class">Popen class</h1>
<p>If there's just one thing in the subprocess module that you should be concerned
with, its the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen"><code>Popen</code></a> class. The other functions like <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call"><code>call</code></a>,
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call"><code>check_output</code></a>, and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call"><code>check_call</code></a> use <code>Popen</code>
internally. Here's the signature from the docs.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bufsize</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">executable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stdin</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="n">creationflags</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I suggest you read the docs for this class. As with all python docs, its really
good.</p>
<h1 id="running-via-the-shell">Running via the shell</h1>
<p>Subprocess can also run command-line instructions via a shell program. This is
usually <code>dash</code>/<code>bash</code> on Linux and <code>cmd</code> on windows.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;ls | wc -l&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">shell</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice that in this case we pass a string, not a list. This is because we want
the shell to interpret the whole of our command. You can even use shell style
quoting if you like. It is up to the shell to decide how to best split the
command line into executable and command line arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On windows, if you pass a list for args, it will be turned into a string using
the same rules as the MS C runtime. See the doc-string for
<code>subprocess.list2cmdline</code> for more on this. Whereas on unix-like systems, even
if you pass a string, its turned into a list of one item :).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The behaviour of the <code>shell</code> argument can sometimes be confusing so I'll try to
clear it a bit here. Something I wished I had when I first encountered this
module.</p>
<p>Firstly, lets consider the case where <code>shell</code> is set to <code>False</code>, the default.
In this case, if <code>args</code> is a string, it is assumed to be the name of the
executable file. Even if it contains spaces. Consider the following.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;ls -l&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This won't work because subprocess is looking for an executable file called <code>ls
-l</code>, but obviously can't find it. However, if <code>args</code> is a list, then the first
item in this list is considered as the executable and the rest of the items in
the list are passed as command line arguments to the program.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;-l&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>does what you think it will.</p>
<p>Second case, with <code>shell</code> set to <code>True</code>, the program that actually gets executed
is the OS default shell, <code>/bin/sh</code> on Linux and <code>cmd.exe</code> on windows. This can
be changed with the <code>executable</code> argument.</p>
<p>When using the shell, <code>args</code> is usually a string, something that will be parsed
by the shell program. The <code>args</code> string is passed as a command line argument to
the shell (with a <code>-c</code> option on Linux) such that the shell will interpret it as
a shell command sequence and process it accordingly. This means you can use all
the shell builtins and goodies that your shell offers.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;ls -l&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">shell</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>is similar to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>/bin/sh -c <span class="s1">&#39;ls -l&#39;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the same vein, if you pass a list as <code>args</code> with <code>shell</code> set to <code>True</code>, all
items in the list are passed as command line arguments to the shell.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;-l&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">shell</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>is similar to</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>/bin/sh -c ls -l
</pre></div>


<p>which is the same as</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>/bin/sh -c ls
</pre></div>


<p>since <code>/bin/sh</code> takes just the argument next to <code>-c</code> as the command line to
execute.</p>
<h1 id="getting-the-return-code-aka-exit-status">Getting the return code (aka exit status)</h1>
<p>If you want to run an external command and its return code is all you're
concerned with, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call"><code>call</code></a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call"><code>check_call</code></a> functions are
what you're looking for. They both return the return code after running the
command. The difference is, <code>check_call</code> raises a <code>CalledProcessError</code> if the
return code is non-zero.</p>
<p>If you've read the docs for these functions, you'll see that its not recommended
to use <code>stdout=PIPE</code> or <code>stderr=PIPE</code>. And if you don't, the <code>stdout</code> and
<code>stderr</code> of the command are just redirected to the parent's (Python VM in this
case) streams.</p>
<p>If that is not what you want, you have to use the <code>Popen</code> class.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">proc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The moment the <code>Popen</code> class is instantiated, the command starts running. You
can wait for it and after its done, access the return code via the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.returncode"><code>returncode</code></a> attribute.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wait</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">returncode</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you are trying this out in a python REPL, you won't see a need to call
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.wait"><code>.wait()</code></a> since you can just wait yourself in the REPL till the command
is finished and then access the <code>returncode</code>. Surprise!</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">proc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">file1</span> <span class="n">file2</span>

<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">returncode</span>
<span class="bp">None</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="c"># wat?</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The command is definitely finished. Why don't we have a return code?</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">wait</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="mi">0</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">returncode</span>
<span class="mi">0</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason for this is the <code>returncode</code> is not automatically set when a process
ends. You have to call <code>.wait</code> or <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen.poll"><code>.poll</code></a> to realize if the program is
done and set the <code>returncode</code> attribute.</p>
<h1 id="io-streams">IO Streams</h1>
<p>The simplest way to get the output of a command, as seen previously, is to use
the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_call"><code>check_output</code></a> function.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">check_output</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;ls&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Notice the <code>check_</code> prefix in the function name? Ring any bell? That's right,
this function will raise a <code>CalledProcessError</code> if the return code is non-zero.</p>
<p>This may not always be the best solution to get the output from a command. If
you do get a <code>CalledProcessError</code> from this function call, unless you have the
contents of <code>stderr</code> you probably have little idea what went wrong. You'll want
to know what's written to the command's <code>stderr</code>.</p>
<h2 id="reading-error-stream">Reading error stream</h2>
<p>There are two ways to get the error output. First is redirecting <code>stderr</code> to
<code>stdout</code> and only being concerned with <code>stdout</code>. This can be done by setting the
<code>stderr</code> argument to <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.STDOUT"><code>subprocess.STDOUT</code></a>.</p>
<p>Second is to create a <code>Popen</code> object with <code>stderr</code> set to
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.PIPE"><code>subprocess.PIPE</code></a> (optionally along with <code>stdout</code> argument) and read
from its <code>stderr</code> attribute which is a readable file-like object. There is also
a convenience method on <code>Popen</code> class, called <code>.communicate</code>, which optionally
takes a string to be sent to the process's <code>stdin</code> and returns a tuple of
<code>(stdout_content, stderr_content)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="watching-both-stdout-and-stderr">Watching both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code></h2>
<p>However, all of these assume that the command runs for some time, prints out a
couple of lines of output and exits, so you can get the output(s) in strings.
This is sometimes not the case. If you want to run a network intensive command
like an svn checkout, which prints each file as and when downloaded, you need
something better.</p>
<p>The initial solution one can think of is this.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">proc</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;svn co svn+ssh://myrepo&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">stdout</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">PIPE</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stdout</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">line</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This works, for the most part. But, again, if there is an error, you'll want to
read <code>stderr</code> too. It would be nice to read <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>
simultaneously. Just like a shell seems to be doing. Alas, this remains a not so
straightforward problem as of today, at least on non-Linux systems.</p>
<p>On Linux (and where its supported), you can use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/select.html"><code>select</code></a> module to
keep an eye on multiple file-like stream objects. But this isn't available on
windows. A more platform independent solution that I found works well, is using
threads and a <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/queue.html#queue-objects"><code>Queue</code></a>.</p>

<p>Fair bit of code. This is a typical producer-consumer thing. Two threads
producing lines of output (one each from <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>) and pushing them
into a queue. One thread watching the queue and printing the lines until the
process itself finishes.</p>

<p>The <code>env</code> argument to <code>Popen</code> (and others) lets you customize the environment of
the command being run. If it is not set, or is set to <code>None</code>, the current
process's environment is used, just as documented.</p>
<p>You might not agree with me, but I feel there are some subtleties with this
argument that should have been mentioned in the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="merge-with-current-environment">Merge with current environment</h2>
<p>One is that if you provide a mapping to <code>env</code>, whatever is in this mapping is
all that's available to the command being run. For example, if you don't give a
<code>TOP_ARG</code> in the <code>env</code> mapping, the command won't see a <code>TOP_ARG</code> in its
environment. So, I frequently find myself doing this</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;command&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">env</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">dict</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">my_env_prop</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;value&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This makes sense once you realize it, but I wish it were at least <em>hinted at</em> in
the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="unicode">Unicode</h2>
<p>Another one, is to do with Unicode (Surprise surprise!). And windows. If you use
<code>unicode</code>s in the <code>env</code> mapping, you get an error saying you can <em>only</em> use
strings in the environment mapping. The worst part about this error is that it
only seems to happen on windows and not on Linux. If its an error to use
<code>unicode</code>s in this place, I wish it break on both platforms.</p>
<p>This issue is very painful if you're like me and use <code>unicode</code> <em>all the time</em>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">__future__</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">unicode_literals</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That line is present in all my python source files. The error message doesn't
even bother to mention that you have <code>unicode</code>s in your <code>env</code> so it's very hard
to understand what's going wrong.</p>
<h1 id="execute-in-a-different-working-directory">Execute in a different working directory</h1>
<p>This is handled by the <code>cwd</code> argument. You set the location of the directory
which you want as the working directory of the program you are launching.</p>
<p>The docs do mention that the working directory is changed <em>before</em> the command
even starts running. But that you <em>can't</em> specify program's path relative to the
<code>cwd</code>. In reality, I found that you <em>can</em> do this.</p>
<p>Either I'm missing something with this or the docs really are inaccurate.
Anyway, this works</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;./ls&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">cwd</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;/bin&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Prints out all the files in <code>/bin</code>. Of course, the following doesn't work when
the working directory is not <code>/bin</code>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">subprocess</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;./ls&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So, if you are giving something explicitly to <code>cwd</code> and are using a relative
path for the executable, this is something to keep in mind.</p>
<h1 id="killing-and-dieing">Killing and dieing</h1>
<p>A simple</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">terminate</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>or for some dramatic umphh!</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">kill</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>will do the trick to end the process. As noted in the documentation, the former
sends a <code>SIGTERM</code> and later sends a <code>SIGKILL</code> on unix, but both do some native
windows-y thing on windows.</p>
<h2 id="auto-kill-on-death">Auto-kill on death</h2>
<p>The processes you start in your python program, stay running even after your
program exits. This is <em>usually</em> what you want, but when you want all your sub
processes killed automatically on exit with <code>Ctrl+C</code> or the like, you have to
use the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/atexit.html"><code>atexit</code></a> module.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">procs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<span class="nd">@atexit.register</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">kill_subprocesses</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">proc</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">procs</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">proc</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">kill</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>And add all the <code>Popen</code> objects created to the <code>procs</code> list. This is the only
solution I found that works best.</p>
<h1 id="launch-commands-in-a-terminal-emulator">Launch commands in a terminal emulator</h1>
<p>On one occasion, I had to write a script that would launch multiple svn
checkouts and then run many ant builds (~20-35) on the checked out projects. In
my opinion, the best and easiest way to do this is to fire up multiple terminal
emulator windows each running an individual checkout/ant-build. This allows us
to monitor each process and even cancel any of them by simply closing the
corresponding terminal emulator window.</p>
<h2 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>This is pretty trivial actually. On Linux, you can use <code>xterm</code> for this.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;xterm&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;-e&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;sleep 3s&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
<p>On windows, its not as straight forward. The first solution for this would be</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;cmd&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;/K&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;command&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<blockquote>
<p><code>/K</code> option tells <code>cmd</code> to run the command and keep the command window from
closing. You may use <code>/C</code> instead to close the command window after the
command finishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As simple as it looks, it has some weird behavior. I don't completely understand
it, but I'll try to explain what I have. When you try to run a python script
with the above <code>Popen</code> call, in a command window like this</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre>python main.py
</pre></div>


<p>you <em>don't</em> see a new command window pop up. Instead, the sub command runs in
the same command window. I have no idea what happens when you run multiple sub
commands this way. (I have only limited access to windows).</p>
<p>If instead you run it in something like an IDE or IDLE (<kbd>F5</kbd>), you have
a new command window open up. I believe one each for each command you run this
way. Just the way you expect.</p>
<p>But I gave up on <code>cmd.exe</code> for this purpose and learnt to use the
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/mintty/"><code>mintty</code></a> utility that comes with <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> (I think 1.7+). <code>mintty</code>
is awesome. Really. Its been a while since I felt that way about a command line
utility on windows.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Popen</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s">&#39;mintty&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;--hold&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;error&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;--exec&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;command&#39;</span><span class="p">])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This. A new <code>mintty</code> console window opens up running the command and it closes
automatically, <em>if</em> the command exits with zero status (that's what <code>--hold
error</code> does). Otherwise, it stays on. Very useful.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The subprocess module is a very useful thing. Spend some time understanding it
better. This is my attempt at helping people with it, and turned out to be way
longer than I'd expected. If there are any inaccuracies in this, or if you have
anything to add, please leave a comment.</p></p>
